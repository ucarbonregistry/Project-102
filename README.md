# Project-102
1.35 MW bundled Solar PV project in Himachal Pradesh, India
This is a bundled project activity of capacity 1.35 MWp which is grid connected solar 
PV power generation project in the state of Himachal Pradesh in India. The promoters of 
the project activity are ‘M/S Chamba Solar Power generating station (500 kW), M/S Kasla Solar 
Power Company (500 kW) and M/S Swarghat Solar Power Project (350 kW)’. As per the ex-ante estimate, 
this project will generate approximately 2,365 MWh of electricity per annum considering an average PLF of 20%.

The project activity aims to harness Solar radiation to generate electricity. The net generated 
electricity from the project activity is sold to state electricity board i.e., Himachal Pradesh State 
Electricity Board Ltd., (HPSEBL) under the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed between the
‘M/S Chamba Solar Power generating station (500 kW) M/S Kasla Solar Power Company (500 kW)
and M/S Swarghat Solar PV Project (350 kW) (Developer)’ (herein after called as Project Proponent 
or PP) and the utility.

In pre-project scenario the State utility was importing the required electricity from the NEWNE grid
to meet its requirement of electrical energy. Currently, NEWNE grid is connected to large numbers 
of fossil fuel-based power plants. Hence, project activity is displacing the gross electricity generation 
i.e., 3951 MWh from the NEWNE grid, which otherwise would have been imported from the grid. 
The project activity doesn’t involve any GHG emission sources.
